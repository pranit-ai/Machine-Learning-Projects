### Rock, Paper, Scissors Hand sign ~ Deep Learning CNN

## Description
This Rock, Paper, Scissors game is built using Python and integrates ResNet50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network model, to recognize hand signs for rock, paper, and scissors.

The second part RPS_Part2.py and RPS_Part3.py are further implemented to pass the images as arguments and to shows the result who wins when compared two images
using the saved deep learning model created during Rock_Paper_Scissor.ipynb file.
