## Project Overview

This repository contains code and data for the project "Road Traffic Forecasting". The project aims to predict traffic counts using various deep learning models, including LSTM and GRU, and visualize traffic points. The code for this project is organized into two main folders: `01-Data Landscape` and '02-Notebooks`.

## Folder Structure

- **data_landscape**: This folder contains dataset files required for the project. However, due to the large size of the "TMS_daily_traffic_counts_API" dataset, it cannot be uploaded here. You can download the dataset from the provided website (https://opendata-nzta.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/NZTA::tms-daily-traffic-counts-api/explore)
, and the file path must be updated accordingly in the code.

- **notebooks**: This folder contains the project code files. The project was developed in Google Colab, so please be aware that file paths may need to be adjusted when running the code on your local machine.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Download the "TMS_daily_traffic_counts_API" dataset from the provided website.
2. Place the downloaded dataset in the `01- Data Landscape/NZ_data/` folder.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks located in the `02-Notebooks` folder.

## Running the Code

1. Start by running the `01-NZ_data.ipynb` file, which contains the dataset setup and preprocessing steps.

2. After successfully running the data setup notebook, proceed to run the `02-Modelling.ipynb` file. This notebook includes the visualization of traffic points and the implementation and comparison of deep learning models like LSTM and GRU for traffic count prediction.

## Note

- Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, and others, as specified in the code files.

- Pay attention to file paths, especially if you are running the code on your local machine. You may need to modify the file paths to match your directory structure.

- If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out for assistance.

Thank you for your interest in this project!
